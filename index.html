<p class="p-text"> <b>Pakistan's Iron Lady</b> Muniba Mazari's life-changing experience led her to become an activist, artist and a motivational speaker. Mazari was appointed as <b>Pakistan's first National Ambassador for UN Women in December 2015, marking the end of a 16-day campaign against gender-based violence.</b></p>

<p class="p-text"> Belonging to a conservative Baloch family, Mazari was married at the age of 18. In her inspiring <b>2014 TED-talk</b> which propelled her into the limelight, Mazari recalled that her marriage was not a happy affair. In <b>2008,</b> while Mazari and her husband were travelling to Rahim Yar Khan from Quetta, they met with an accident after her spouse fell asleep at the wheel. While her former husband managed to escape from the toppled car,  Mazari lay trapped under the wrecked car and as a result sustained a lot of injuries. The radius ulna of her right arm was fractured, her entire ribcage was fractured and due to the ribcage injury, her lungs and liver were severely injured.</p>
<p class="p-text"> Passersby saved her by laying her at the back of an empty jeep and driving her to the nearest hospital which was approximately three hours drive away from the site of the accident. At the hospital, she discovered that half of her body was fractured and the other half paralysed. </p>
<h2 id="headline-3" class="main-text"> A True Artist</h2>

<p class="p-text">Mazari's true aspiration was to become an artist and as she lay on the hospital bed the doctor dashed her dream by informing her that she would not be able to hold a paintbrush again due the multiple injuries she had sustained. Being the harbinger of bad news, the doctor told Mazari that she would not be able to walk nor could she have a child.</p>
<p class="p-text"> What devastated Mizari was the fact that she could not experience motherhood. She explained how the importance of motherhood is inculcated in every Pakistani girl from a very young age, the notion that if a woman cannot have a child then <b>"she is incomplete."</b></p>
<p class="p-text"> With that epiphany, Mazari decided to add some colour in her life. She asked her brothers for a paint supplies and a canvas and she started painting.</p>

<p class="p-text">She spoke about her fears during that time and her biggest fears were divorce and not experiencing motherhood. The fears that had been ingrained by societal pressures. Mazari decided to overcome those fears one by one.</p>
<p class="p-text"> She overcame her second fear by choosing to adopt a child. Mazari recalled the moment she went to pick up the child from the orphanage. The security guard inspected her closely and she was afraid that he would not deem her a suitable mother since she was differently abled. The guard relieved her off her fears by assuring her that she was the best mother for this child.</p>

<p class="p-text"> In a bid to change the outlook of people towards those who are differently abled, Mazari started to speak more in public, to appear in advertisements for various companies, to paint more; thus becoming <b>Pakistan's first wheelchair bound artist.</b> </p>
<p class="p-text"> Refusing to portray herself as <b>"an emblem of sympathy",</b> Mazari rejected campaigns that would paint her as a victim of undesirable consequences. She appeared as an anchor on Pakistan national television and did numerous shows.</p>
<p class="p-text"> Mazari was also featured in <b>BBC's 'Hundred Women for 2015' and Forbes '30 under 30.'</b> Muniba Mazari continues to be a powerful voice for <b>inclusion and diversity in Pakistan.</b> She is critical about the way people view those who are differently abled. One of the most powerful moments for her was when she met an Army Public School survivor. In <b>2014,</b> terrorists stormed into Army Public School Peshawar where they shot and martyred many children and teachers. One of the survivors, and <b>Mazari's 'real life hero',</b> is a boy named <b>Waleed Khan.</b> Khan protected students and as a result was shot and sustained injuries that left him wheelchair bound. Mazari spoke of the dillemma she was faced with, where she was asked to console this child and assure him that everything will be okay. Khan surprised her by requesting for a selfie. It was then when Mazari was self critical, that she too thought about his deformities.</p>
<p class="p-text"> Mazari considers her personal pain to be beautiful as it allows her to connect with other people who are in pain. Her resilience, determination and strong voice continue to inspire many in Pakistan and internationally.</p>
<p class="p-text"> Always attributing her strength to her mother, she shared that the first time she realised that <b>heroes have no gender</b> was when her mother believed in her and assured her that <b>"this too shall pass."</b><p>
